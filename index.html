              A friend and I set out to tackle what we saw as a serious problem: people have a hard time saving money. By creating what we call “a FitBit for saving”, we believe it’s possible to encourage healthy financial behavior in a simple and fun way. We started by hosting a series of interviews to gain insights and validate our assumptions. The biggest challenge was onboarding new users given the complexity and sensitivity of finances. This is a case where simple proved to be very difficult to attain. Eventually we did and after a series of rapid prototyping iterations, our MVP was ready for development. We handed off our interactive prototype and design assets to a dev agency. On a daily basis I consult with our developer team to review architectural decisions, ensure quality, and iron out bugs. The app is in early alpha as we continue to test and prepare for release.

          <p>a productivity tool designed for the apple watch to help you focus and get things done</p>

              Around the time the Apple Watch was announced I was inspired by its haptic technology and decided to build an app around it. The idea is based on the Pomodoro Technique, which involves focus-break cycles and a noisy tomato timer. My biggest insight happened when I imagined someone with a loud timer in a quiet library. As it turns out, a silent tap on the wrist makes for a more nuanced solution. Much of the challenge involved working with a very restricted watchOS API. On the graphic side, the design of the tick markers was also a challenge—though it proved to be a great way to sharpen my design skills.  As for the user experience, the overarching idea was to make you feel like you had a productivity-superpower. Silo’s simplicity resonates with a number of different target audiences. Silo became a nice success on the App Store, and I soon followed it up with Silo Zen, for meditation, and Silo Trainer, for HIIT workouts.

              A longtime goal of mine has been to create an app for exploring dreams. For a long time I mulled over the question: “What if you could wake up inside your dream, experience impossible journeys, and improve your waking life?”If you’ve ever had a lucid dream, you know that it is quite a unique and empowering experience. While there are well documented techniques of inducing lucid dreams, however, they are cumbersome and require a good deal of time to master. In this project I am challenging myself to make it easier to not only attain lucidity quickly, but to turn dreams into virtual experiences you can learn and grow from. As a personal project, I am taking my time with this one and believe I can design a good experience since it’s an app that I myself would be using. One challenge I find exciting about this project is making the best of design affordances, as I am working with two separate interfaces (watch and phone).

              This was a collaboration with a graduate student conducting their thesis study on health plan choices. Working together, we designed what would become a web-app for a decision-making tool that compared health plans offered by Tufts University. The general idea was to create a simple flow for staff members that guided them through a series of questions. Based on their entries, the consecutive screens would update with information about the different health plans and the complexities of health insurance in general. At the end of the flow, the users were shown different cards for each plan with a rating system of up to five stars (in our case hearts) to help them decide the best plan for their needs.

              This was a pro bono effort with a team of three designers to redesign a logo and branding material for TEDx Youth. We were given only 12 hours to complete the two main task. It began with each of us sketching our ideas to share with the client during a one-time meeting. After getting raw feedback, we worked together to brainstorm and combine the best ideas we had. The result was a net positive collaborative effort that illuminated the power of teamwork. As an example, a first of the designers had unknowingly sketched what looked to be the shape of the X, a second designer happened to notice that the X could simultaneously appear as an X and Y, meanwhile a third designer had the skillset to execute the logo beautifully. Based on the logo the remaining assets became easier as we were able to use constraint to our benefit.
